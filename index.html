      <p>
        Hi, I'm Syeda Shakera. I'm studying at Code the Dream. After finishing
        my engineering degree, I realized my true interest lies in coding. I'm
        passionate about problem-solving and love the creative challenges that
        coding brings. I'm excited to learn new languages and skills to become a
        proficient coder. My aim is to work on innovative projects that make a
        difference.
